have indeed received srorn Beda a different inter·
pretation from that which we have here assign-
ed to thern. That writer understands them as
meaning that the siege os Kair Badon occurred
¹sorty-four years after the arrival of the Saxons in
England,¹ whereas they seem rather to show that
Gildas wrote his Epistle forty-four years after
that siege, he being then in the sorty-fourth year
of his age.2 Admitting that Beda has here, as
elsewhere,³ been misled by the turgid and in·
volved style of the author, it remains for usto lix
the date os the siege of Kair Badon, which, as has
been already stated, was coeval with the birth os
Gildas. The argument in favour of the year
520 rests partly upon the direct authority of Mat-
thew of Wcstminstcr,⁴ and partly upon the data
furnished by an anonymous British chronicler,⁵ '
who affirms that twenty-two years elapsed be-
